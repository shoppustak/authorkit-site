            <p class="text-xl text-gray-600 max-w-3xl mx-auto">
                AuthorKit was created to solve a problem we kept seeing: talented authors spending hours wrestling with website plugins that weren't designed for books.

    <!-- The Problem -->
    <section class="py-12 bg-white">
        <div class="max-w-4xl mx-auto px-4 sm:px-6 lg:px-8">
            <div class="prose prose-lg max-w-none">
                <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                    The result? Messy, slow sites—and author brands that didn't match the quality of the work.
                </p>
                <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                    We're Swati and Maulik, siblings who built AuthorKit to change that. Swati writes and publishes. Maulik designs. We both know what it's like to watch good work buried under bad tools.

    <!-- Origin Story -->
    <section class="py-16 bg-gray-50">
        <div class="max-w-4xl mx-auto px-4 sm:px-6 lg:px-8">
            <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-8">Our Story</h2>

            <div class="prose prose-lg max-w-none">
                <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                    <strong>Swati</strong> spent years in roles that demanded precision under pressure—as a paramedic, then as an educator for over a decade, and later as a content writer and translator. She writes and publishes stories and poetry across English and Gujarati, exploring human emotions and relationships. <a href="https://swatisjournal.com" class="text-blue-600 hover:text-blue-700" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Visit Swati's Journal →</a>
                </p>

                <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                    But when it came to showcasing her published work online, the tools failed her. Book plugins were either bloated with features she didn't need, incompatible with her WordPress theme, or so complex they required a developer just to display a simple catalog. Her author website—the face of her work—couldn't match the care and craft she put into her writing.
                </p>

                <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                    <strong>Maulik</strong> has spent years as a freelance artist, designing for clients who needed their work to look professional without technical headaches. <a href="https://maulikmehta.com" class="text-blue-600 hover:text-blue-700" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">View Maulik's Portfolio →</a> When Swati described her WordPress struggles, the problem was clear: authors shouldn't need to become developers just to showcase their books.
                </p>

                <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                    So we built AuthorKit. Not for everyone at first—just for authors like Swati who needed something that worked.

                That same "make it clear, make it human, make it work" mindset that guided Swati's teaching and writing is what AuthorKit brings to WordPress.
